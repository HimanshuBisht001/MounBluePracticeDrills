1. Create the following directory structure.

hello
├── five
│   └── six
│       ├── c.txt
│       └── seven
│           └── error.log
└── one
    ├── a.txt
    ├── b.txt
    └── two
        ├── d.txt
        └── three
            ├── e.txt
            └── four
                └── access.log

Command      -->  (i) mkdir -p hello/five/six/seven hello/one/two/three/four
                  (ii) touch hello/five/six/c.txt hello/five/six/seven/error.log hello/one/a.txt hello/one/b.txt hello/one/two/d.txt hello/one/two/three/e.txt hello/one/two/three/four/access.log
Explaination -->  (i) The command creates the nested directories hello/five/six/seven and hello/one/two/three/four, automatically creating any missing parent directories without errors.
                  (ii) The command creates empty files at the specified paths within the hello directory structure.


2. Delete all the files having the .log extension
Command      --> find -type f -name "*.log" -exec rm -f {} \;
Explaination --> searches for all files (-type f) with a .log extension and deletes them using the rm -f command. The {} is replaced by each file found, and \; indicates the end of the exec command.

3. Add the following content to a.txt
    Unix is a family of multitasking, multiuser computer operating systems that derive from the original AT&T Unix,
    development starting in the 1970s at the Bell Labs research center by Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, and others

Command      --> echo "Unix is a family of multitasking, multiuser computer operating systems that derive from the original AT&T Unix, development starting in the 1970s at the Bell Labs research center by Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, and others" >> hello/one/a.txt
Explaination --> The command appends the specified text to the file hello/one/a.txt without overwriting its existing content.

4. Delete the directory named five
Command      --> rm -r hello/five
Explaination --> Deletes the hello/five directory and all its contents recursively.

5. Rename the one directory to uno
Command      --> mv hello/one hello/uno
Explaination --> Renames the hello/one directory to hello/uno

6. Move a.txt to the two directory
Command      --> mv hello/uno/a.txt hello/uno/two/
Explaination --> Moves the a.txt file from hello/uno to hello/uno/two/
